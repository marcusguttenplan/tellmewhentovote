##usage

<b>tellmewhentovote</b> is built on the MEAN stack.

```
brew install mongodb
```

set up authentication, users, and roles; then mongoimport the dates into the database (fill in the values for each switch):

```
mongoimport --username --password --db  --collections  --type csv --headerline --file
```

```
npm install
```

Now, in one terminal window run `gulp`, and in another run `node server.js`.

These will in turn output:

```
